# Microbiota perturbation or elimination can inhibit normal development and elicit a starvation-like response in an omnivorous model invertebrate.

### Here you will find all the scripts used to quantify and analyze the transcriptional changes in _P.americana_ gut by RNAseq.

* All scripts are in the [scr](https://github.com/avera1988/P.americana_RNAseq/tree/main/scr) folder. Each subfolder contains scripts for the particular steep in the analysis. For example the folder [DifferentialExpressionAnalysis](https://github.com/avera1988/P.americana_RNAseq/tree/main/scr/DifferentialExpressionAnalysis) has all the R scripts for DE analysis in all transcripts.
